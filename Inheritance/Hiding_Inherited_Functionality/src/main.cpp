/*
C++ gives us the ability to change an inherited member’s access specifier in the derived class.
This is done by using a using declaration to identify the (scoped) base class member that is
having its access changed in the derived class, under the new access specifier.

You can only change the access specifiers of base members the derived class would normally be able to access.
Therefore, you can never change the access specifier of a base member from private to protected or public,
because derived classes do not have access to private members of the base class.
